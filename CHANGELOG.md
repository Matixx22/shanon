Nothing yet.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-28

First tagged release.

### Added

- Deterministic `anonymize` and `restore` commands for SharpHound / BloodHound
  collections, preserving the exact JSON format and graph cross-references.
- Fail-closed two-pass pipeline with an independent verification stage and atomic
  no-replace publication.
- Reversal map with stable pseudonyms across collections via `--reuse-map`.
- Prebuilt release binaries for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and
  `aarch64-apple-darwin`. Intel macOS is not published separately — the arm64
  build runs under Rosetta 2, and building from source is supported everywhere.
- Community health files: contributing guide, code of conduct, issue and pull
  request templates, and Dependabot config.
- `rust-toolchain.toml` pinning local development to the MSRV (1.97), so a
  feature newer than the floor fails at edit time instead of in CI. The `test`
  job overrides it with `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=stable` to keep stable coverage.
- Supply-chain CI: a `cargo deny` job checking advisories, licenses, bans, and
  source registries, configured in `deny.toml`. Supersedes the former
  `cargo audit` job — same RustSec database, plus license enforcement so an
  MIT-licensed binary cannot silently redistribute a conflicting dependency.
